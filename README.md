**Work in progress.**
This project was made while learning React v16. It's an app that helps everyone who wants to move in France to find his perfect location.
I took datas from INSEE and french government to make the criterias that are used to define the best destination.

## Technical scope

To make this project I use : - Figma to mockup the web app - Create React App to bootstrap the project - JSX - functionnal components - Hooks (useState, useEffect...) - PropTypes to add a static typing layer - Styled Components to handle styling and responsive webdesign - ESLint - Prettier - Restful API (Node and Express) [Ailleurs-API](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
