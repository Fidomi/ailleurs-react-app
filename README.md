**Work in progress.**
This project was made while learning React v17. It's an app that helps everyone who wants to move in France to find his perfect location.
I took datas from INSEE and french government to make the criterias that are used to define the best destination.

1.  Figma to mockup the web app
2.  Create React App to bootstrap the project
3.  JSX
4.  functionnal components
5.  Hooks (useState, useEffect...)
